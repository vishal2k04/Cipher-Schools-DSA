PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING: derived from structural programming 
-> program is divided into small parts called functions.
-> follow top to bottom approach
-> no proper way to hide data and is less secure.
-> adding new data is not easy. Ex: C,Pascal, Basic etc.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS): program is divided into small parts called objects.
-> follows bottom to top approach.
-> data hiding is possible and is more secure.
-> Adding data is easier. Ex: C++, Java,Python etc.
