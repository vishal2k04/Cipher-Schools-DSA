GIT: Git is an open-source distributed version control system.
-> It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency.
-> The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.
-> Git allows the creation of multiple branches without affecting each other. We can perform tasks like creation, deletion, 
and merging on branches.

STAGING AREA: An intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completion. 
-> When you make a commit, Git takes changes that are in the staging area and make them as a new commit.

GitHub: GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. 
-> It offers both distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git.
-> It also facilitates with some collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management for every project.

Commands:
-> git init
This will create a .git folder at your project root and will allow you to start using Git in that repository.

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
-> git add .

Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
-> git commit -m "First commit"

-> git remote add origin <Repository_Location>
You can call origin whatever you like, really, but origin is the standard name for Git remote repositories.

-> git remote -v
Verifies the new remote URL

-> git push origin main
You can now push your changes.
